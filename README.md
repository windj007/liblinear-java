This is a fork of original repository https://github.com/bwaldvogel/liblinear-java with a patch for incremental and decremental learning applied.

Original version of liblinear implementing incremental and decremental learning can be found here http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/ws/index.html.

Currently the work in the very beginning.
